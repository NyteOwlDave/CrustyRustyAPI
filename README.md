# CrustyRustyAPI

Dave's JavaScript Math API

The date is early June of 2023. Dave is messing around with writing some Rust Math routines and digging
up my old math routines and libraries from a half dozen languages and four decades.

Most of the recent stuff was in JavaScript. The older stuff was in C/C++. The eldest of all was in BASIC.

Dozens of projects with math modules scattered all over. Many were half completed. Many were poorly
done -- just enough to make the project work.

I decided enough was enough -- it was a foregone conclusion that a comprehensive suite of math-related
APIs were in order. Something consistent and clean. Something that covered all the basics and the bases.

Thus was born Crusty Rusty -- formed out of the fevered brain of someone recently initiated to (and
passionate about) the Rust language. Even though the original implementation is in JavaScript, the
core notion can easily be ported to other languages (and most likely will, with Rust being an early
candidate).
